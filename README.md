# 42Lisboa Push Swap

Welcome to **Push Swap**, the algorithmic challenge that will twist your brain and sharpen your coding skills!

## 🎲 What is Push Swap?
Push Swap is a sorting problem: given a stack of integers, sort them using only a limited set of stack operations. The goal? Sort the stack in as few moves as possible.

## ✨ Features
- Custom stack implementation in C
- Efficient sorting algorithms designed for minimal moves
- Visualization and debugging tools to track your progress

## 🏆 Why is this project cool?
- It’s not just sorting, it’s sorting with constraints!
- Teaches you to optimize algorithms and think outside the box
- Compete with classmates for the fastest, smartest solution

## 🛠️ Getting Started
Clone, compile with `make`, and let the sorting battle begin!  
Feed in your numbers, watch the moves, and measure your efficiency.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
- Master stack data structures and algorithms
- Learn to analyze and optimize time/space complexity
- Develop performance-oriented C programming habits
